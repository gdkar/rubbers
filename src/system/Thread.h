/**
  The Condition class bundles a condition variable and mutex.

  To wait on a condition, call lock(), test the termination condition
  if desired, then wait().  The condition will be unlocked during the
  wait and re-locked when wait() returns (which will happen when the
  condition is signalled or the timer times out).

  To signal a condition, call signal().  If the condition is signalled
  between lock() and wait(), the signal may be missed by the waiting
  thread.  To avoid this, the signalling thread should also lock the
  condition before calling signal() and unlock it afterwards.
